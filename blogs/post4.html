    <h2>Day 4: Don't Lose What You Have 🙏</h2>
    <em>November 01, 2025</em>
    <p>Hey, it's been a long time. I've had work and, honestly, I've been so lazy these days. I actually want to write, but I'm too lazy to open the laptop. That's why I haven't written anything lately.</p>
    <p>Okay, today's topic is: <strong>don't lose what you have.</strong> If you have anything, be grateful for it. If you lose it once, you might not get it back. It could be a person, a thing, or anything in the universe. Be grateful for what you have, man. Don't lose it.</p>
    <p>I think you know what I'm talking about. I lost my favorite person—the girl with the nose pierce. Her beauty lies in that nose pierce. It's really tough to move on, but what can you do? Whatever happens, life has to move on, right?</p>
    <p>I tried so many things to forget her. I even went to Varanasi, and that trip taught me a lot about life. I'll share more about that in my next blog, so stay tuned. Peace out. ✌️</p>
