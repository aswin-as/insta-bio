    <h2>Access to Opportunity: Why Skill Alone Isn’t Enough</h2>
    <em>November 5, 2025</em>
    <p>I recently came across a talk about access to opportunity, and it really made me think. The main idea is simple but powerful: life isn’t just about how skilled you are — it’s about what opportunities you can actually reach.</p>
    <p>The speaker explained three main barriers, or what he called “gates,” that decide who gets access to opportunities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Family Wealth</strong> – If your family has money, it’s naturally easier to get ahead. From education to networks, resources from family can open doors that others might never even see.</li>
      <li><strong>Where You’re Born and Raised</strong> – Your environment matters a lot. The city, neighborhood, or country you grow up in can either give you access to opportunities or make them really hard to find.</li>
      <li><strong>Health</strong> – Being healthy isn’t just about feeling good — it affects how much you can take advantage of opportunities. Poor health can limit choices and make it harder to succeed, no matter how talented you are.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even if someone works hard or has great skills, these gates can make life much harder compared to someone born into privilege. The takeaway: it’s not just skill — it’s about the doors you can reach and actually walk through.</p>
    <p>Understanding this helps us see why true equality of opportunity is still far from reality. Talent and hard work matter, but systemic factors play a huge role in who gets ahead.</p>
    <p>My colleague Risaj, who is like a brother to me, also told me about this once. I’ve been thinking about how to make these gates more accessible for the underprivileged. I’m planning to write a blog about this after doing some research.</p> <a href="javascript:history.back()" class="btn">← Back to Blog</a>
